             <p>The word anime is a shortened form of the <b> word animÄ“shon, which means "animation." While anime has its roots in Japan, it has since spread to other countries, </b>and today, anime can be found in many different languages, including English.Anime doesn't have short stories, although it's a good way for them to know what the story plot will be. If you think about short stories, that's basically what manga is, but without pictures.</p>
